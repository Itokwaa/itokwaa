## Why are you here??

Well, Hello! I'm Itokwaa.

Welcome to my profile, where I document my ongoing battle with the goblins but often frustrating art of digital creation. I'm currently new and am dedicating my time to figuring out why my projects work flawlessly in the tutorials but decide to put up a fight on my local machine.

Current Mission: Turning my very cool codes to a life.

Skills Under Development: 

Thanks for stopping by! Let's connect and share the coding joy/struggle.
